# real_time_FER_using_DL_with_RIDNET
In this study, emotion recognition process is performed by using deep learning methods for seven different facial expressions from the dataset (RidNet) which is created by using images that are publicly accessible from internet. Afterwards, transfer learning over RidNet is done with well-known convolutional neural network architectures such as AlexNet, GoogLeNet and ResNet101. Compound Facial Expressions of Emotion (CE) and Static Facial Expressions in the Wild (SFEW) datasets are determined to be used as test datasets. In the first experimental studies, convolutional neural network architecture with the best classification performance is determined. This convolutional neural network is trained using AffectNet, The Karolinska Directed Emotional Faces and RidNet. Similar classification performances are achieved when the AffectNet, KDEF, and RidNet-trained networks are tested with the dataset (CE) generated in a controlled environment. In the test dataset (SFEW) in an uncontrolled environment, RidNet-trained network gives a significant advantage over the other networks.
